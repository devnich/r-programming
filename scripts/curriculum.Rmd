## Project Management

```{verbatim project_tree}

project_name
├── project_name.Rproj
├── README.md
├── script_1.R
├── script_2.R
├── data
│   ├── processed
│   └── raw

```

## Data Structures

### Coercion Rules

```{verbatim coercion}

logical -> integer -> numeric -> complex -> character

```

### Challenge 1

1.  Make a vector with numbers 1 - 26
2.  Multiply the vector by 2
3.  Name the vector elements A - Z (Hint: there is a built-in vector called `LETTERS`)
4.  Print the last five items

### Challenge 2

You want to produce the following matrix:

```{verbatim matrix_wrapping}

     [,1] [,2]
[1,]    4    1
[2,]    9    5
[3,]   10    7
```

Which of the following is correct command to do that?

```{r matrix_creation_options}

matrix(c(4, 1, 9, 5, 10, 7), nrow = 3)
matrix(c(4, 9, 10, 1, 5, 7), ncol = 2, byrow = TRUE)
matrix(c(4, 9, 10, 1, 5, 7), nrow = 2)
matrix(c(4, 1, 9, 5, 10, 7), ncol = 2, byrow = TRUE)
```

## Exploring Data Frames

### Challenge 3

Look at the help documentation for the `data.frame` function. Create a new data frame from `gapminder` that includes the following columns:

1.  country
2.  year
3.  gdpPercap

### Challenge 4

Create a new data frame that contains all of the 21st century data from European countries.

## Control Flow

### Conditional template

```{r conditional_statements}

# if
if (condition is true) {
    perform action
}

# if ... else
if (condition is true) {
    perform action
} else {  # if the condition is false,
    perform alternative action
}
```

### Iteration template

```{r for_loops}

for (item in collection) {
  do something
}
```

### Challenge 5

We would like to sum the following sequence:

```{r}
x = (1^2) + (2^2) + (3^2) + ... + (n^2)
```

This would be tedious to type out, and impossible for high values of n.

1.  Use vectorisation to compute x when n=100.
2.  What is the sum when n=10,000?

## Functions

### Function template

```{r functions}

my_function <- function(parameters) {
    do something
    return value
}
```

### Challenge 6

1.  Calculate the total GDP for each North American country in 1952 and 1957
2.  Save your results as a CSV file called `north_america_1.csv` in a subfolder called `processed`.

## Data frame manipulation with dplyr

### dplyr functions

```{r dplyr_verbs}

select()
filter()
group_by()
summarize()
mutate()

```

### Challenge 7

Create a data frame that has the African values for `lifeExp`, `country`, and `year`.

### Challenge 8

1.  Calculate the average life expectancy in 2002 of 2 randomly selected countries for each continent.
2.  Then arrange the continent names in reverse order.

Hint: Use the dplyr functions `arrange()` and `sample_n()`. They have similar syntax to other dplyr functions.

## Tidyverse in the wild

```{r tidyverse_example}

deaths %>% rename (age_group = "Ten-Year Age Groups",
                   injury_mechanism = "Injury Mechanism & All Other Leading Causes") %>%
    rename_with (tolower) %>%
    mutate (precov = if_else(year < 2020, 'precov', 'postcov')) %>%
    group_by (age_group, race, gender, injury_mechanism, precov) %>%
    summarise (across (c(deaths, population), mean)) %>%
    pivot_wider (names_from = 'precov', values_from = c(deaths, population)) %>%
    select (!c(ends_with('NA'))) %>%
    na.omit() %>%
    mutate (death_increases = deaths_postcov - deaths_precov) %>%
    arrange (desc(death_increases)) %>%
    group_by (age_group, race, gender) %>%
    filter (death increases == max(death increases)) %>%
    ungroup %>%
        arrange (desc(death_increases)) %>%
        select (age_group, race, gender, injury _mechanism, death _increases) %>%
        filter (age_group %in% c('15-24 years', '25-34 years', '25-44 years', '45-54 years')) %>%
        print (n=32)

```

## ggplot2

### ggplot2 template

```{r ggplot2_template}

ggplot(data = <data>,
       mapping = aes(<mappings>)) +
  geom_xxx()

```
