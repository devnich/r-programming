# **WEEK 1: Fundamentals**

# Introduction to RStudio

## Orientation

![Building programs that support your research
workflow.](images/data-science-workflow.png "Data science workflow")

1.  R was created by statisticians for statisticians (and other
    researchers)
2.  R contains multitudes; this can be good and bad

## RStudio configuration

### Configuration menu

1.  PC/Linux: Tools \> Global Options
2.  MacOS: RStudio \> Preferences *or* Tools \> Global Options

### Helpful configuration settings

1.  General \> Basic
    -   Don\'t save or restore .RData
2.  Code \> Editing
    -   Use native pipe operator
    -   Ctrl+Enter executes single line (or Multi-line R statement)
3.  Code \> Display
    -   Rainbow parentheses
4.  Appearance: Adjust font and syntax colors
5.  Pane Layout: Move IDE panes

## (Optional) Workstation configuration

By default, your view of your file system will be opaque. We want to
make it transparent (e.g.Â you may have a local Desktop and a cloud
Desktop folder).

### Mac OS Finder \> Preferences

Your local Desktop folder is in your Home directory.

1.  General
    1.  New finder window shows: /Users/\<home\>
2.  Sidebar
    1.  Favorites: /Users/\<home\>
    2.  iCloud: iCloud Drive
    3.  Locations: \<computer name\>, Cloud Storage
3.  Advanced
    1.  Show all filename extensions
    2.  Keep folders on top (all)

### Windows System \> File Explorer

Your local Desktop folder is in your Home directory or Computer
directory.

1.  File \> Change folder and search options \> View
    1.  Files and Folders
        1.  Show hidden files, folders, and drives
        2.  Hide protected operating system files
        3.  **Uncheck** Hide extensions for known file types
    2.  Navigation Pane
        1.  Show all folders
2.  View
    1.  File name extensions

## Workflow in RStudio

1.  Set working directory

2.  Test code snippets in the R console \[REPL\]

    ``` r
    print("hello")
    ```

3.  Create an .R script in the working directory

    ``` r
    print("hello")
    ```

4.  **Run** the script

    1.  Keyboard shortcut
        -   Windows/Linux: `Control-Enter`
        -   MacOS: `Command-Enter`
    2.  Run button
    3.  Highlight and run lines

5.  **Source** the script to reduce console clutter and make contents
    available to other scripts

    -   <https://stackoverflow.com/a/24418219>
    -   <https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200484448-Editing-and-Executing-Code>

6.  **Insert** assignment arrow `<-`

    -   MacOS: `Option -`
    -   Windows/Linux: `Alt -`
    -   Good customization: `Control -`

7.  **Break** execution if console hangs

    1.  Windows: `ESC`
    2.  MacOS/Linux: `Control-c`

8.  **Clear** console

    1.  RStudio: `C-l`
    2.  Emacs: `C-c M-o` / `M-x comint-clear-buffer`

9.  **Comment/Uncomment** code

    -   MacOS: `Command-/`

# Introduction to R

A whirlwind tour of R fundamentals

## Mathematical expressions

``` r
1 + 100
(3 + 5) * 2  # operator precedence
5 * (3 ^ 2)  # powers
2/10000      # outputs 2e-04
2 * 10^(-4)  # 2e-04 explicated
```

## Built-in functions

1.  Some functions need inputs (\"arguments\")

    ``` r
    getwd()      # no argument required
    sin(1)       # requires arg
    log(1)       # natural log
    ```

2.  RStudio has auto-completion

    ``` r
    log...
    ```

3.  Use `help()` to find out more about a function

    ``` r
    help(exp)
    exp(0.5)    # e^(1/2)
    ```

## Comparing things

1.  Basic comparisons

    ``` r
    1 == 1
    1 != 2
    1 < 2
    1 <= 1
    ```

2.  Use `all.equal()` for floating point numbers

    ``` r
    all.equal(3.0, 3.0)        # TRUE
    all.equal(2.99, 3.0)       # 7 places: Gives difference
    all.equal(2.99999999, 3.0) # 8 places: TRUE
    2.99999999 == 3.0          # 8 places: FALSE
    ```

## Variables and assignment

1.  R uses the assignment arrow (`C-c C-=` in ESS)

    ``` r
    # Assign a value to the variable name
    x <- 0.025
    ```

2.  You can inspect a variable\'s value in the Environment tab or by
    evaluating it in the console

    ``` r
    # Evaluate the variable and echo its value to the console
    x
    ```

3.  Variables can be re-used and re-assigned

    ``` r
    log(x)
    x <- 100
    x <- x + 1
    y <- x * 2
    ```

4.  Use a standard naming scheme for your variables

    ``` r
    r.style.variable <- 10
    python_style_variable <- 11
    javaStyleVariable <- 12
    ```

## Vectorization

Vectorize all the things! This makes idiomatic R very different from
most programming languages, which use iteration (\"for\" loops) by
default.

``` r
# Create a sequence 1 - 5
1:5

# Raise 2 to the Nth power for each element of the sequence
2^(1:5)

# Assign the resulting vector to a variable
v <- 1:5
2^v
```

## Managing your environment

``` r
ls()             # List the objects in the environment
ls               # Echo the contents of ls(), i.e. the code
rm(x)            # Remove the x object
rm(list = ls())  # Remove all objects in environment
```

Note that parameter passing (`=`) is not the same as assignment (`<-`)
in R!

## Built-in data sets

``` r
data()
```

## R Packages

\"Package\" and \"library\" are roughly interchangeable.

1.  Install additional packages

    ``` r
    install.packages("tidyverse")
    ## install.packages("rmarkdown")
    ```

2.  Activate a package for use

    ``` r
    library("tidyverse")
    ```

# Project management with RStudio

## General file management

See /scripts/curriculum.Rmd

``` example
project_name
âââ project_name.Rproj
âââ README.md
âââ script_1.R
âââ script_2.R
âââ data
â   âââ processed
â   âââ raw
âââ results
âââ temp
```

## Create projects with Rstudio

1.  File \> New Project
2.  Create in existing Folder
3.  If you close RStudio and double-click Rproj, RStudio will open to
    the project location and set the working directory.

# Seeking help

## Basic help syntax

``` r
help(write.csv)
?write.csv
```

## Help file format

1.  Description
2.  Usage
3.  Arguments
4.  Details
5.  Examples (highlight and run with `C-Enter`)

## Special operators

``` r
help("<-")
```

## Library examples

``` r
vignette("dplyr")
```

## What if you don\'t know where to start?

1.  RStudio autocomplete

2.  Fuzzy search

    ``` r
    ??set
    ```

3.  Browse by topic: <https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/>

# Data structures

## R stores \"atomic\" data as vectors

There are no scalars in R; everything is a vector, even if it\'s a
vector of length 1.

``` r
v <- 1:5

length(v)
length(3.14)
```

## Every vector has a type

There are 5 basic (vector) data types: double, integer, complex, logical
and character.

``` r
typeof(v)
typeof(3.14)
typeof(1L)
typeof(1+1i)
typeof(TRUE)
typeof("banana")
```

## Vectors and type coercion

1.  A vector must be all one type. If you mix types, R will perform type
    coercion. See coercion rules in scripts/curriculum.Rmd

    ``` r
    c(2, 6, '3')
    c(0, TRUE)
    ```

2.  You can change vector types

    ``` r
    # Create a character vector
    chr_vector <- c('0', '2', '4')
    str(chr_vector)

    # Use it to create a numeric vector
    num_vector <- as.numeric(chr_vector)

    # Show the structure of the collection
    str(num_vector)
    ```

3.  There are multiple ways to generate vectors

    ``` r
    # Two options for generating sequences
    1:10
    seq(10)

    # The seq() function is more flexible
    series <- seq(1, 10, by=0.1)
    series
    ```

4.  Get information about a collection

    ``` r
    # Don't print everything to the screen
    length(series)
    head(series)
    tail(series, n=2)
    ```

    ``` r
    # You can add informative labels to most things in R
    names(v) <- c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e")
    v
    str(v)
    ```

5.  Get an item by its position or label

    ``` r
    v[1]
    v["a"]
    ```

6.  Set an item by its position or label

    ``` r
    v[1] = 4
    v
    ```

7.  (Optional) New vectors are empty by default

    ``` r
    # Vectors are logical by default
    vector1 <- vector(length = 3)
    vector1

    # You can specify the type of an empty vector
    vector2 <- vector(mode="character", length = 3)
    vector2
    str(vector2)
    ```

## **Challenge 1**: Generate and label a vector

See /scripts/curriculum.Rmd

## Matrices

1.  A matrix is 2-dimensional vector

    ``` r
    # Create a matrix of zeros
    mat1 <- matrix(0, ncol = 6, nrow = 3)

    # Inspect it
    class(mat1)
    typeof(mat1)
    str(mat1)
    ```

2.  Some operations act as if the matrix is a 1-D wrapped vector

    ``` r
    mat2 <- matrix(1:25, nrow = 5, byrow = TRUE)
    str(mat2)
    length(mat2)
    ```

## (Optional) Factors

1.  Factors represent unique levels (e.g., experimental conditions)

    ``` r
    coats <- c("tabby", "tortoise", "tortoise", "black", "tabby")
    str(coats)

    # The reprentation has 3 levels, some of which have multiple instances
    categories <- factor(coats)
    str(categories)
    ```

2.  R assumes that the first factor represents the baseline level, so
    you may need to change your factor ordering so that it makes sense
    for your variables

    ``` r
    ## "control" should be the baseline, regardless of trial order
    trials <- c("manipulation", "control", "control", "manipulation")

    trial_factors <- factor(trials, levels = c("control", "manipulation"))
    str(trial_factors)
    ```

## Data Frames are central to working with tabular data

1.  Create a data frame

    ``` r
    coat = c("calico", "black", "tabby")
    weight = c(2.1, 5.0, 3.2)
    chases_bugs = c(1, 0, 1)

    cats <- data.frame(coat, weight, chases_bugs)

    cats         # show contents of data frame
    str(cats)    # inspect structure of data frame

    # Convert chases_bugs to logical vector
    cats$chases_bugs <- as.logical(cats$chases_bugs)
    str(cats)
    ```

2.  Write the data frame to a CSV and re-import it. You can use
    `read.delim()` for tab-delimited files, or `read.table()` for
    flexible, general-purpose input.

    ``` r
    write.csv(x = cats, file = "../data/feline_data.csv", row.names = FALSE)
    cats <- read.csv(file = "../data/feline_data.csv", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)

    str(cats) # the chr column is now a factor column
    ```

3.  Access the column (vectors) of the data frame

    ``` r
    cats$weight
    cats$coat
    ```

4.  A vector can only hold one type. Therefore, in a data frame each
    data column (vector) has to be a single type.

    ``` r
    typeof(cats$weight)
    ```

5.  Use data frame vectors in operations

    ``` r
    cats$weight + 2
    paste("My cat is", cats$coat)

    # Operations have to be legal for the data type
    cats$coat + 2

    # Operations are ephemeral unless their outputs are reassigned to the variable
    cats <- cats$weight + 1
    ```

6.  Data frames have column names `names()` gets or sets a name

    ``` r
    names(cats)
    names(cats)[2] <- "weight_kg"
    cats
    ```

## Lists

1.  Lists can contain anything

    ``` r
    list1 <- list(1, "a", TRUE, 1+4i)

    # Inspect each element of the list
    list1[[1]]
    list1[[2]]
    list1[[3]]
    list1[[4]]
    ```

    If you use a single bracket `[]`, you get back a shorter section of
    the list, which is also a list. Use double brackets `[[]]` to drill
    down to the actual value.

2.  (Optional) This includes complex data structures

    ``` r
    list2 <- list(title = "Numbers", numbers = 1:10, data = TRUE)

    # Single brackets retrieve a slice of the list, containing the name:value pair
    list2[2]

    # Double brackets retrieve the value, i.e. the contents of the list item
    list2[[2]]
    ```

3.  Data frames are lists of vectors and factors

    ``` r
    typeof(cats)
    ```

4.  Some operations return lists, others return vectors (basically, are
    you getting the column with its label, or are you drilling down to
    the data?)

    1.  Get list slices

        ``` r
        # List slices
        cats[1]      # list slice by index
        cats["coat"] # list slice by name
        cats[1, ]    # get data frame row by row number
        ```

    2.  Get list contents (in this case, vectors)

        ``` r
        # List contents (in this case, vectors)
        cats[[1]]      # content by index
        cats[["coat"]] # content by name
        cats$coat      # content by name; shorthand for `cats[["coat"]]`
        cats[, 1]      # content by index, across all rows
        cats[1, 1]     # content by index, single row
        ```

    3.  You can inspect all of these with `typeof()`

    4.  Note that you can address data frames by row and columns

## **(Optional) Challenge 2**: Creating matrices

See /scripts/curriculum.Rmd

# Exploring data frames

## Adding columns

``` r
age <- c(2, 3, 5)
cbind(cats, age)
cats                     # cats is unchanged
cats <- cbind(cats, age) # overwrite old cats
```

``` r
# Data frames enforce consistency
age <- c(2, 5)
cats <- cbind(cats, age)
```

## Appending rows (remember, rows are lists!)

``` r
newRow <- list("tortoiseshell", 3.3, TRUE, 9)
cats <- rbind(cats, newRow)

# Legal values added, illegal values are NA
cats

# Update the factor set so that "tortoiseshell" is a legal value
levels(cats$coat) <- c(levels(cats$coat), "tortoiseshell")
cats <- rbind(cats, list("tortoiseshell", 3.3, TRUE, 9))
```

## Removing missing data

`cats` is now polluted with missing data

``` r
na.omit(cats)
cats
cats <- na.omit(cats)
```

## Working with realistic data

``` r
gapminder <- read.csv("data/gapminder_data.csv", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)

# Get an overview of the data frame
str(gapminder)
dim(gapminder)

# It's a list
length(gapminder)
colnames(gapminder)

# Look at the data
summary(gapminder$gdpPercap)  # summary varies by data type
head(gapminder)
```

## **Challenge 3**: New gapminder data frame

See /scripts/curriculum.Rmd

# Subsetting data

## Subset by index

``` r
v <- 1:5
```

1.  Index selection

    ``` r
    v[1]
    v[1:3]     # index range
    v[c(1, 3)] # selected indices
    ```

2.  (Optional) Index exclusion

    ``` r
    v[-1]
    v[-c(1, 3)]
    ```

## Subset by name

``` r
letters[1:5]
names(v) <- letters[1:5]
```

1.  Character selection

    ``` r
    v["a"]
    v[names(v) %in% c("a", "c")]
    ```

2.  (Optional) Character exclusion

    ``` r
    v[! names(v) %in% c("a", "c")]
    ```

## Subsetting matrices

``` r
m <- matrix(1:28, nrow = 7, byrow = TRUE)

# Matrices are just 2D vectors
m[2:4, 1:3]
m[c(1, 3, 5), c(2, 4)]
```

## (Optional) Extracting list elements

Single brackets get you subsets of the same type (`list -> list`,
`vector -> vector`, etc.). Double brackets extract the underlying vector
from a list or data frame.

``` r
# Create a new list and give it names
l <- replicate(5, sample(15), simplify = FALSE)
names(l) <- letters[1:5]

# You can extract one element
l[[1]]
l[["a"]]

# You can't extract multiple elements
l[[1:3]]
l[[names(l) %in% c("a", "c")]]
```

## Subsetting by logical operations

1.  Explicitly mask each item using TRUE or FALSE. This returns the
    reduced vector.

    ``` r
    v[c(FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)]
    ```

2.  Evaluate the truth of each item, then produce the TRUE ones

    ``` r
    # Use a criterion to generate a truth vector
    v > 4

    # Filter the original vector by the criterion
    v[v > 4]
    ```

3.  Combining logical operations

    ``` r
    v[v < 3 | v > 4]
    ```

## (Optional) Subset by factor

``` r
# First three items
gapminder$country[1:3]

# All items in factor set
north_america <- c("Canada", "Mexico", "United States")
gapminder$country[gapminder$country %in% north_america]
```

## Subsetting Data Frames

Data frames have characteristics of both lists and matrices.

1.  Get first three rows

    ``` r
    gapminder <- read.csv("../data/gapminder_data.csv", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)

    # Get first three rows
    gapminder[1:3,]
    ```

2.  Rows and columns

    ``` r
    gapminder[1:6, 1:3]
    gapminder[1:6, c("country", "pop")]
    ```

3.  Data frames are lists, so one index gets you the **columns**

    ``` r
    gapminder[1:3]
    ```

4.  Filter by contents

    ``` r
    gapminder[gapminder$country == "Mexico",]
    north_america <- c("Canada", "Mexico", "United States")
    gapminder[gapminder$country %in% north_america,]
    gapminder[gapminder$country %in% north_america & gapminder$year > 1999,]
    gapminder[gapminder$country %in% north_america & gapminder$year > 1999, c("country", "pop")]
    ```

## **Challenge 4**: Extract data by region

See /scripts/curriculum.Rmd

# **WEEK 2: Building Programs in R**

# Control flow

## Conditionals

1.  Look at Conditional template in curriculum.Rmd

2.  If

    ``` r
    x <- 8

    if (x >= 10) {
      print("x is greater than or equal to 10")
    }
    ```

3.  Else

    ``` r
    if (x >= 10) {
      print("x is greater than or equal to 10")
    } else {
      print("x is less than 10")
    }
    ```

4.  Else If

    ``` r
    if (x >= 10) {
      print("x is greater than or equal to 10")
    } else if (x > 5) {
      print("x is greater than 5, but less than 10")
    } else {
      print("x is less than 5")
    }
    ```

5.  Vectorize your tests

    ``` r
    x <- 1:4

    if any(x < 2) {
      print("Some x less than 2")
    }

    if all(x < 2){
      print("All x less than 2")
    }
    ```

## Review Subsetting section

Subsetting is frequently an alternative to if-else statements in R

## Iteration

1.  Look at Iteration template in curriculum.Rmd

2.  Basic For loop

    ``` r
    for (i in 1:10) {
      print(i)
    }
    ```

3.  Nested For loop

    ``` r
    for (i in 1:5) {
      for (j in letters[1:4]) {
        print(paste(i,j))
      }
    }
    ```

4.  This is where we skip the example where we append things to the end
    of a data frame. For loops are slow, vectorize operations are fast
    (and idiomatic). Use for loops where they\'re the appropriate tool
    (e.g., loading files, cycling through whole data sets, etc). We will
    see more of this in the section on reading and writing data.

# Vectorization

## Vector operations are element-wise by default

``` r
x <- 1:4
y <- 6:9
x + y
log(x)

# A more realistic example
gapminder$pop_millions <- gapminder$pop / 1e6
head(gapminder)
```

## Vectors of unequal length are recycled

``` r
z <- 1:2
x + z
```

## Logical comparisons

``` r
x > 2
a <- (x > 2) # you can assign the output to a variable

# Evaluate a boolean vector
any(a)
all(a)
```

## Matrix operations are also element-wise by default

``` r
m <- matrix(1:12, nrow=3, ncol=4)

# Multiply each item by -1
m * -1
```

## Linear algebra uses matrix multiplication

``` r
# Multiply two vectors
1:4 %*% 1:4

# Matrix-wise multiplication
m2 <- matrix(1, nrow = 4, ncol = 1)
m2
m %*% m2

# Most functions operate on the whole vector or matrix
mean(m)
sum(m)
```

## **Challenge 5**: Sum of squares

See /scripts/curriculum.Rmd

# Higher-order functions

`apply()` lets you apply an arbitrary function over a collection. This
is an example of a higher-order function (map, apply, filter, reduce,
fold, etc.) that can (and should) replace loops for most purposes. They
are an intermediate case between vectorized operations (very fast) and
for loops (very slow). Use them when you need to build a new collection
and vectorized operations aren\'t available.

## `apply()`: Apply a function over the margins of an array

``` r
m <- matrix(1:28, nrow = 7, byrow = TRUE)

apply(m, 1, mean)
apply(m, 2, mean)
apply(m, 1, sum)
apply(m, 2, sum)
```

## `lapply()`: Apply a function over a list, returning a list

``` r
lst <- list(title = "Numbers", numbers = 1:10, data = TRUE)

## length() returns the length of the whole list
length(lst)

## Use lapply() to get the length of the individual elements
lapply(lst, length)
```

## `sapply()`: Apply a function polymorphically over list, returning vector, matrix, or array as appropriate

``` r
## Simplify and return a vector by default
sapply(lst, length)

## Optionally, eturn the original data type
sapply(lst, length, simplify = FALSE)
```

## Use `apply` and friends to extract nested data from a list

1.  Read a file JSON into a nested list

    ``` r
    ## Read JSON file into nested list
    library("jsonlite")
    books <- fromJSON("../data/books.json")

    ## View list structure
    str(books)
    ```

2.  Extract all of the authors with `lapply()`. This requires us to
    define an *anonymous function*.

    ``` r
    authors <- lapply(books, function(x) x$author)

    ## Returns list
    str(authors)
    ```

3.  Extract all of the authors with `sapply()`

    ``` r
    authors <- sapply(books, function(x) x$author)

    # Returns vector
    str(authors)
    ```

## (Optional) Use `purrr:::map_chr()` to extract nested data from a list

``` r
## View the relevant map function
library("purrr")
help(map_chr)

## Returns vector
authors <- map_chr(books, ~.x$author)
```

1.  The \~\~.x\~ operation in Purrr creates an anonymous function that
    applies to all the elements in the collection (in general, the
    Tidyverse uses `.` as a shorthand for \"for each element\")

# Functions explained

Functions let you encapsulate and re-use chunks of code. This has
several benefits:

1.  Eliminates repetition in your code. This saves labor, but more
    importantly it reduces errors, and makes it easier for you to find
    and correct errors.
2.  Allows you to write more generic (i.e.Â flexible) code.
3.  Reduces cognitive overhead.

## Defining a function

1.  Look at Function template in data/curriculum.Rmd

2.  Define a simple function

    ``` r
    # Convert Fahrenheit to Celcius
    f_to_celcius <- function(temp) {
      celcius <- (temp - 32) * (5/9)
      return(celcius)
    }
    ```

3.  Call the function

    ``` r
    f_to_celcius(32)

    boiling <- f_to_celcius(212)
    ```

## Combining functions

Define a second function and call the first function within the second.

``` r
f_to_kelvin <- function(temp) {
  celcius <- f_to_celcius(temp)
  kelvin <- celcius + 273.15
  return(kelvin)
}

f_to_kelvin(212)
```

## Most functions work with collections

``` r
## Create a vector of temperatures
temps <- seq(from = 1, to = 101, by = 10)

# Vectorized calculation (fast)
f_to_kelvin(temps)

# Apply
sapply(temps, f_to_kelvin)
```

## Defensive programming

1.  Check whether input meets criteria before proceeding (this is
    \`assert\` in other languages).

    ``` r
    f_to_celcius <- function(temp) {
      ## Check inputs
      stopifnot(is.numeric(temp), temp > -460)
      celcius <- (temp - 32) * (5/9)
      return(celcius)
    }

    f_to_celcius("a")
    f_to_celcius(-470)
    ```

2.  Fail with a custom error if criterion not met

    ``` r
    f_to_celcius <- function(temp) {
      if(!is.numeric(temp)) {
        stop("temp must be a numeric vector")
      }
      celcius <- (temp - 32) * (5/9)

      return(celcius)
    }
    ```

## Working with rich data

1.  Calculate the total GDP for each entry in the data set

    ``` r
    gdp <- gapminder$pop * gapminder$gdpPercap
    ```

2.  Write a function to perform a total GDP calculation on a filtered
    subset of your data.

    ``` r
    calcGDP <- function(df, year=NULL, country=NULL) {
      if(!is.null(year)) {
        df <- df[df$year %in% year, ]
      }
      if (!is.null(country)) {
        df <- df[df$country %in% country,]
      }
      gdp <- df$pop * df$gdpPercap

      new_df <- cbind(df, totalGDP=gdp)
      return(new_df)
    }
    ```

3.  Mutating `df` inside the function doesn\'t affect the global
    `gapminder` data frame (because of pass-by-value and scope).

## **Challenge 6**: Testing and debugging your function

See data/curriculum.Rmd

# Reading and writing data

## Create sample data sets and write them to the \`data\` directory

``` r
for (year in unique(gapminder$year)) {
  df <- calcGDP(gapminder, year = year, country = north_america)

  ## Generate a file name
  fname <- paste("processed/north_america_", as.character(year), ".csv", sep = "")

  ## Write the file
  write.csv(x = df, file = fname, row.names = FALSE)
}
```

## How to find files

``` r
## Get matching files from the `data` subdirectory
dir(path = "processed", pattern = "north_america_[1-9]*.csv")
```

## Read files using a for loop

1.  Read each file into a data frame and add it to a list

    ``` r
    ## Create an empty list
    df_list <- list()

    ## Get the locations of the matching files
    file_names <- dir(path = "processed", pattern = "north_america_[1-9]*.csv")

    for (f in file_names){
      df_list[[f]] <- read.csv(file = file.path("processed", f))
    }
    ```

2.  Access the list items to view the individual data frames

    ``` r
    length(df_list)
    names(df_list)
    df_list[["north_america_1952.csv"]]
    ```

## Read files using apply

1.  Instead of a for loop that handles each file individually, use a
    single vectorized function.

    ``` r
    df_list <- lapply(file.path("processed", file_names), read.csv)
    ```

2.  This doesn\'t add names by default, so you will have to add them
    manually

    ``` r
    ## You can still access by index position
    df_list[[2]]

    names(df_list)
    names(df_list) <- file_names
    df_list[["north_america_1952.csv"]]
    ```

    <https://stats.oarc.ucla.edu/r/library/r-library-contrast-coding-systems-for-categorical-variables/>

    If you tell R that a factor is ordered, it defaults to Orthogonal
    polynomial contrasts. This means that it assumes you want it to
    check for linear, cubic, and quadratic trends. If you tell R that a
    factor is NOT ordered, it defaults to treatment contrasts: it
    compares all levels to a reference level. This probably doesn\'t
    make sense for lots of psych data. So if I say income is ordered, it
    calculates linear, quadratic etc. trends for income, which is not
    only not what I want, but is inappropriate unless your groups are
    evenly spaced. Treatment means it calculates whether each level is
    significantly different from a reference level (i.e.Â the highest
    income group).

    So if you want first-year stats output in a design with more than 2
    levels in the factor, put this at the top of the R code:

    ``` r
    options(contrasts = c("contr.sum","contr.poly"))
    ```

    `contr.sum` is R for deviation contrasts, which you may recall as
    contrasts like -1, 0, 1.
