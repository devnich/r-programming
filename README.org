* Introduction to R and RStudio
** Orientation
#+CAPTION: Building programs that support your research workflow.
#+NAME: Data science workflow
[[file:images/data-science-workflow.png]]
1. R was created by statisticians for statisticians (and other researchers)
2. R contains multitudes; this can be good and bad

** Workstation configuration
By default, your view of your file system will be opaque. We want to make it transparent (e.g. you may have a local Desktop and a cloud Desktop folder).

*** Mac OS Finder > Preferences
Your local Desktop folder is in your Home directory.
1. General
   1. New finder window shows: /Users/<home>
2. Sidebar
   1. Favorites: /Users/<home>
   2. iCloud: iCloud Drive
   3. Locations: <computer name>, Cloud Storage
3. Advanced
   1. Show all filename extensions
   2. Keep folders on top (all)

*** Windows System > File Explorer
Your local Desktop folder is in your Home directory or Computer directory.
1. File > Change folder and search options > View
   1. Files and Folders
      1. Show hidden files, folders, and drives
      2. Hide protected operating system files
      3. *Uncheck* Hide extensions for known file types
   2. Navigation Pane
      1. Show all folders
2. View
   1. File name extensions

** RStudio configuration
1. Don't save or restore .RData (General > Basic)
2. Use native pipe operator (Code > Editing)
3. Rainbow parentheses (Editing > Display)
4. Adjust font and syntax colors (Appearance)
5. Move stuff around (Pane Layout)

3. Various approaches to contrast coding: https://stats.oarc.ucla.edu/r/library/r-library-contrast-coding-systems-for-categorical-variables/

   If you tell R that a factor is ordered, it defaults to Orthogonal polynomial contrasts. This means that it assumes you want it to check for linear, cubic, and quadratic trends. If you tell R that a factor is NOT ordered, it defaults to treatment contrasts: it compares all levels to a reference level. This probably doesn't make sense for lots of psych data. So if I say income is ordered, it calculates linear, quadratic etc. trends for income, which is not only not what I want, but is inappropriate unless your groups are evenly spaced. Treatment means it calculates whether each level is significantly different from a reference level (i.e. the highest income group).

   So if you want first-year stats output in a design with more than 2 levels in the factor, put this at the top of the R code:
   #+BEGIN_SRC R
   options(contrasts = c("contr.sum","contr.poly"))
   #+END_SRC

   ~contr.sum~ is R for deviation contrasts, which you may recall as contrasts like -1, 0, 1.

* COMMENT How to export this document to other formats
** Export to Markdown using Emacs Org mode
Do this if you want a table of contents on Github.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
M-x org-md-export-to-markdown
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Export to Markdown using Pandoc
Do this if you want code syntax highlighting and a table of contents on Github.
*** Generate generic Markdown file
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
pandoc README.org -o tmp.md
#+END_SRC

*** Edit generic Markdown file to remove illegal front matter
1. Org directives
2. Anything that isn't part of the document structure (e.g. TODO items)

*** Generate Github Markdown with table of contents
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
pandoc -f markdown --toc --toc-depth=2 -s tmp.md -o README.md
#+END_SRC

*** Find and replace code block markers in final document
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
M-x qrr " {.r}" "r"
M-x qrr " {.bash}" "bash"
#+END_EXAMPLE
